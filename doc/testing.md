1. We plan to use WebdriverIO (a test automation framework) to test:

- Button and click functionality
- Functionality on different operating systems
- API function calls
- Forms
- App health

2. We will manually test:

- UI design
- Directory structure

Testing with Webdriver IO:

- cd into electron-app
- in the commandline: npx wdio run wdio.conf.js
